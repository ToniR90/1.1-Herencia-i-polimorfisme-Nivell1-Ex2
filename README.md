# 1.1-Herencia-i-polimorfisme-Nivell1-Ex2

üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement
This project demonstrates the difference between various types of attributes in Java (`static final`, `static`, and `final`), how to initialize them, and when they are suitable for use in a constructor. Additionally, the project explores static and non-static methods and shows how to invoke them from the `main()` method.

### Exercise Objective:
1. Create a `Car` class with the following attributes:
   - `brand`: A `static final` attribute representing the car's brand.
   - `model`: A `static` attribute representing the car's model.
   - `power`: A `final` attribute representing the car's power.

   Show the differences between these attributes and identify which ones can be initialized in the class constructor.

2. Add two methods to the `Car` class:
   - `stop()`: A static method that prints "the car is braking" to the console.
   - `accelerate()`: A non-static method that prints "The car is accelerating" to the console.

3. Demonstrate how to invoke both the static and non-static methods from the `main()` method.
